abstract = {The dissociative water potential introduced by Garofalini et al. proved to be a simple and effective description to account for proton transfer in aqueous media, enabling for instance the execution of simulation studies at different pH values. In this model the charge of each particle is represented by a point-charge surrounded by a Gaussian charge-cloud of opposite sign, thus four Coulombic terms (point-charge-point-charge, point-charge-charge-cloud, charge-cloud-point-charge and charge-cloud-charge-cloud) are required per atom pair. In this work it is demonstrated that the Gaussian charge distributions can be removed from the model after a minor modification of the overall atomic point-charges. Despite this substantial modification of the model, structural properties obtained via pair- and angle distributions remain largely unaffected and the change in dynamical properties (vibrational frequencies, proton transfer properties) was found to be minor. As an additional improvement an adjustment of the bending mode vibration was carried out by carefully evaluating the parametrization of the three-body interaction potential, thereby retaining the good agreement of the transfer properties of the aqueous excess proton reported in an earlier study. The proposed simple point-charge (SPC) type parametrization of the Coulombic interactions not only leads to a notable decrease in computational demand but generalizes the dissociative model by improving its transferability to established third-party simulation software and enabling the application of different theoretical approaches such as Ewald summation techniques not considered in the original parametrization. The outlined optimization strategy demonstrates that despite the complex and challenging formulation of the force field, various dynamical properties can be selectively adjusted without influencing other critical parameters of the simulated systems.},

@article{Mark2001,
abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of five water models, the TIP3P (original and modified), SPC (original and refined), and SPC/E (original), were performed using the CHARMM molecular mechanics program. All simulations were carried out in the microcanonical NVE ensemble, using 901 water molecules in a cubic simulation cell furnished with periodic boundary conditions at 298 K. The SHAKE algorithm was used to keep water molecules rigid. Nanosecond trajectories were calculated with all water models for high statistical accuracy. The characteristic self-diffusion coefficients D and radial distribution functions, gOO, gOH, and gHH for all five water models were determined and compared to experimental data. The effects of velocity rescaling on the self-diffusion coefficient D were examined. All these empirical water models used in this study are similar by having three interaction sites, but the small differences in their pair potentials composed of Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Coulombic terms give significant differences in the calculated self-diffusion coefficients, and in the height of the second peak of the radial distribution function gOO.},
